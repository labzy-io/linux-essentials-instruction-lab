# Linux Essentials — Detailed Lab Overview

## Duration
**3 Hours (12 Steps)**

## Audience
This lab is designed for **complete beginners** (equivalent to 10th grade students) who are learning Linux and the terminal for the first time.  
No prior Linux knowledge is assumed. Each instruction is step-by-step and written in simple language.

## Lab Format
- **Instruction Lab**: You will be guided through commands and concepts directly.  
- **Hands-On Practice**: You will type commands into the terminal and observe outputs.  
- **Validation Tasks**: At the end, optional tasks (Git & Networking) include helper files and validation scripts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Open and use the Linux terminal effectively.  
2. Navigate the filesystem and perform file operations.  
3. View, search, and filter text files.  
4. Manage processes and jobs (foreground/background).  
5. Understand file permissions and change them with `chmod` and `chown`.  
6. Gather system information (disk, memory, uptime).  
7. Perform basic networking commands (ping, DNS lookups, open ports).  
8. Archive and compress files using `tar` and `gzip`.  
9. Use the package manager (`apt`) to install and remove software.  
10. Write and run simple shell scripts.  
11. Permissions Challenge.  
12. Troubleshoot connectivity and DNS resolution.

## Structure
- **Steps 1–10**: Core Linux skills (approx. 200 minutes).  
- **Steps 11–12**: Validation tasks with helpers (approx. 30 minutes).  
- Each step is **10 minutes** on average, but you may take longer as you practice.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24 (or similar Linux distribution).  
- **Tools**: Terminal application (bash shell).  
- **Network**: Internet connection for package installation and DNS tests.  
- **Permissions**: Some tasks require `sudo` access (administrator rights).  

## Key Skills Practiced
- Working with the Linux command line  
- Creating and organizing files and directories  
- Redirecting and searching text output  
- Managing processes and monitoring system usage  
- Adjusting permissions for files and directories  
- Compressing and archiving data  
- Installing/removing software with APT  
- Writing and running bash scripts  
- Using Git for version control  
- Troubleshooting basic networking issues  

## Suggested Workflow
1. **Follow each step in order.** Each builds on the previous one.  
2. **Type commands manually.** Avoid copy-paste to build muscle memory.  
3. **Observe the output carefully.** Compare it with expected results.  
4. **Repeat tasks** if something doesn’t work — troubleshooting is part of learning.  
5. **Try variations** (e.g., different filenames, directories) to deepen your understanding.  

## Completion Criteria
- You have successfully completed all 10 instructional steps.  
- You optionally attempted Steps 11 and 12 and passed the provided validation scripts.  
- You are comfortable using the Linux terminal for basic daily tasks.
